* We'll start with the Basic HTML and Basic CSS sections on freeCodeCamp and get as far as we can!

## Participants

Our audience is adults learning about coding with HTML and CSS for the first time. Coaches will be experienced developers. 

We expect to have about 20 attendees, a facilitator, 7-8 coaches, and 1-2 general volunteers. Members of underrepresented groups are highly encouraged to apply and attend.

* We need some coaches for this workshop! Coaching is pretty low-key and low-stress.

## Sponsors

We’re looking for sponsors to cover the costs for this workshop so that it’s free for community members to attend.
